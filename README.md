# Spotlights Background

This is a basic example of what can be accomplished using kinetic.js library to abstract HTML5 canvas API.

Open `index.html` in any modern browser and you will see a nice full window background with dancing flashlights which automatically resizes and scales when the browser window is resized.

Original code is written in coffeescript, and can be recompiled with `coffee -cwo js coffee`
